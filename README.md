This just a ruler for measuring distance between two blocks
This program uses simple math formula for finding distance between two blocks:
sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2+(z2-z1)^2)

## Do you need that program ?
actually, no but I was using this a lot while playing with my friends and I wanted to make this more.
